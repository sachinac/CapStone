### Abstract

With globalization, the capital markets have exploded in size and value and are exceedingly difficult to predict. These days the public has access to real-time data of the market leading to more participation. As a positive step this might lead to better wealth distribution in the society, it also adds to the random nature of the market and make it more unpredictable. The portfolio accounts consisting of stocks and bonds are considered serious investment assets. They can make or break a person’s future. It is also a way of shielding one against risk or rising inflation. These accounts when managed well will grow in value and can keep an individual’s finances healthy. The management of these accounts require good knowledge of markets and periodic adjustment of assets in the account.
